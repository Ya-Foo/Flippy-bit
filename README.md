# Flippy-bit

To commemorate Edward, the True Champion

## Released

eddy (v1) - first version, had flaws such as occasional strokes  
big ed (v2) - added bullet spray at death wave + more efficient mapping of hex--key which enables "piano" playstyle

## Future plan

UPCOMING: GIGA ed (v3)  
Features planned:

1. analyse the distribution of the hex spawned. If there's a pattern then when the deathwave comes, add in the weighing of the distribution
2. OR find a way to extract seed of randomise function of game. From that can predict every hex that will spawn --> 100% hit in the death wave
3. OR in death wave switch to targetting individual hex instead?
4. Prevents any user input
5. Because death wave arrives at different score on different machines, have GIGA ed play a trial round to find out when this will occur. 
Then use that data to determine when to switch to bullet spray mode.

## Analysis and comparison

Plot histogram/distribution chart to compare different versions of ed
Tryna think of a way that other ppl can contribute data to this
