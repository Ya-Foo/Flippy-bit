# Flippy-bit

To commemorate Edward, the True Champion

## Released

eddy (v1) - first version, had flaws such as occasional strokes  
big ed (v2) - more efficient mapping of hex--key which enables "piano" playstyle

## Future plan

UPCOMING: GIGA ed (v3)  
Features planned:

1. find a way to extract seed of randomise function of game. From that can predict every hex that will spawn --> 100% hit in the death wave
2. OR in death wave switch to targetting individual hex instead?
3. Prevents any user input
4. On slower computers the program would stop after a while, so find out when this occurs by
playing a trial round then after 2nd play, switch to bullet spray mode after that threshold

## Analysis and comparison

Plot histogram/distribution chart to compare different versions of ed  
Tryna think of a way that other ppl can contribute data to this
